## EDC Inventory

A review of the things that I carried in 2022 and what will power 2023.

- [Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L ($300)](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack?variant=29743300902956):
  By far one of the best investments I’ve made - after hunting
  across 3 different backpacks in 6 months, the Everyday has become an
  essential item in my inventory with the amount of space that it
  gives me to carry just about anything I may need.
- [14” M1 Pro MacBook Pro ($2,000)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch):
  I technically got this late 2021 but it’s still by far the most
  powerful machine that I’ve owned and my go-to for just about
  anything.
- [12.9” M1 iPad Pro + Apple Pencil ($1,300)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro):
  I got my iPad at the beginning of my sophomore year and it has
  become my favorite Apple product to date: the ease of taking notes,
  annotating PowerPoints, and being able to read in a quick fashion
  has made me fall in love with portability all over again.
- [Sony A7iii ($2,000)](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7m3-b):
  Acquired from good friend Ayman, I’d been wanting to dive into
  photography for YEARS but never knew where to start with equipment -
  Ayman was selling some of his old gear and lenses and after playing
  with it for a week I had fallen in love with capturing moments in
  front of me. I’m still very new to it and forever will be learning,
  but it’s a great place to start.
- [Worrybricks Sapphire + Worm ($60)](https://worrybricks.com/):
  A bit of a niche need, but with ADHD I’m constantly fiddling with
  rings and anything I can get my hands on - the combination of these
  two fidget toys have kept my hands busy and my mind focused.
- [AirPods Max ($500)](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/):
  These were a gift from a friend but regardless are my favorite pair
  of headphones that I’ve ever owned - being spoiled by the noise
  cancelling definitely will set the bar for any future pair of
  headphones I own.

## 2023 Goals

- [ ] Finally visit Europe with my friends!
- [ ] Move out & begin to build my own space
- [ ] 10,000 followers on TikTok
- [ ] Pay off my camera through photography gigs
- [ ] Meet the rest of my internet friends I didn’t get to see this year
- [ ] Continue to change the world, in any way possible.
